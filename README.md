# Cinema Management Information System

This project was developed as part of the Database and Object Orientation exam at the University of Naples Federico II.

## Project Description

The developed system is a Java application with a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using Java Swing or JavaFX. The main goal of the system is to manage a multiscreen cinema, keeping track of movies screened in each theater, scheduling each show, and the unique characteristics of each theater, such as Dolby audio or IMAX technology.

## Key Features

The information system offers the following functionalities:

- **Movie Management:** Allows inserting, modifying, and deleting movie information, including title, genre, duration, and more.

- **Show Scheduling:** Enables scheduling shows based on theater and movie availability, considering peak hour periods.

- **Theater Management:** Records the characteristics of each theater, such as capacity, presence of advanced audio and video technologies.

- **Data Analysis:** Provides tools to estimate peak hour periods, identify the most profitable shows, and theaters busiest during peak hours.

## Technologies Used

The system was developed using the following technologies:

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Graphical User Interface:** Java Swing / JavaFX
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (or other relational database)

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following folders:

- **src:** Contains the Java source code of the application.
- **docs:** Project documentation, including UML diagrams, user manual, etc.
- **sql:** SQL scripts for creating and initializing the database.

## Installation and Execution Instructions

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Import the project into your preferred IDE.
3. Execute the SQL scripts in the `sql` folder to create the database.
4. Configure the database connection settings in the configuration file.
5. Compile and run the application.
